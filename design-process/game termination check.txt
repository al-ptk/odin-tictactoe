What is the line size for winning?
In normal tictactoe, the winning line is 3,
but bigger grids have a 4-unit line

Keep track of all moves made by each player
Keep the numbers in ascending order

Winning rules for 3x3 grid with 3-unit line
Vertical: n, n + w, n + (w * 2)
Horizontal: n, n + 1, n + 2
Backslash: n, n + w + 1, n + (w + 1) * 2
Forwardslash: n, n + (w - 1), n + (w - 1) * 2

Possible Solution #1
Cache all win conditions
Take the index of last move made
For all cached win conditions
    if the index is in the a particular win condition
        if all indexes have same symbol
            return 'WON!!'

WINNER! (for now)
Possible Solution #2 — caching links instead of cells
take recent move
if any same-symbol neighbours
    cache link
if two links have a number in common
    sort all indexes by ascending order
    if fit Horizontal
       or fit Vertical
       or fit Backslash
       or fit Forwardslash
            return 'win'



proc IsGameOver
    take the last move made by the player 
    // that way, I only need to check around that point,
    // not the whole grid
    Check if there is a win condition on board
        If so, game is over
            return true, winner 

    // Checking for tie is easy — just see if the grid
    // is full. I have already checked for wins, so, 
    // there can only be empty spots or tie.
    Check if there is no more valid moves
        If so, game is over
            return true, 'tie'
    
    return false
