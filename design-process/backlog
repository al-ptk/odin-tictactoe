Implementation details:

    Javascipt:
    
        • A function that checks if a possible index is out of bounds
        • The player factory and game module
    
    CSS:

        • Find decent symbols to use in the game, that are svg
        • Figure out how to change the color of embeded svg

    HTML-DOM:

        •

Features that could be cool:

    • Each person can customize their symbol and color
    • The game has different color schemes
    • Maybe putting a three people mode?
