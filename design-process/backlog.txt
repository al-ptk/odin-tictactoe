Implementation details:

    Javascipt:
    
        • A function that checks if a possible index is out of bounds
        • The game module
    
    CSS:

        • Find decent symbols to use in the game, that are svg
        • Figure out how to change the color of embeded svg

    HTML-DOM:

        • Create the pickGameMode modal (vs player, vs ai)
        • Create the pickGridSize modal (3x3, 5x5, 7x7)
        • Create Title screen with new game button
        • Create Grid screen with the current match
        • The flow of the app will be seen by openinig-closing modals, as well as changing screens (detach one, attach another).

Features that could be cool:

    • Each person can customize their symbol and color
    • The game has different color schemes
    • Maybe putting a three people mode?
