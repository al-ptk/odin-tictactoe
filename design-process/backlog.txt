Implementation details:

    HTML-DOM:

        • Get player profile modal (symbol and color ONLY);


    UI\Cosmetics that I procrastinate on

        • Change color of symbols

    CSS:

        • Find decent symbols to use in the game, that are svg
        • Figure out how to change the color of embeded svg
        • Pick good fonts
        • Set the three color schemes:
            • Dark and light brown, Dark and Light green, Silver;
            • Navy blue, Yellow and silver;
            • Graphite, yellow, pink and silver;
            • Graphite, yellow, pink, blue
            • Shades of gray — Lighter graphite and darker silver (instead of white) with shados in letters
        • Makke the tic-tac-toe letters animate
        • Use a 5x5 grid to add some X's and O's
        • Which symbols should I add to the game?


Features that could be cool:

    • Each person can customize their symbol and color
    • The game has different color schemes
    • Maybe putting a three people mode?
    • Add cards\special resources to spice the gameplay up?
    • Add inteligence to the AiFactory

    Refactoring
    • Improve the whole modals and screens stack navigation thing buzzword
    
    Javascipt — Pure-Functions Branch:

        • Maybe decopuple all functions from player object, leaving it only with data (name, score, symbol, color, etc)
        • make hasVictory its own function, with all extra functions internal to it
