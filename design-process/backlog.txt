Implementation details:

    Javascipt:
    
        • How will I do 2 player human players thing? Maybe I can put a turn flag — only when the flag is set that the input is accepted.
        • The game module
        • Make the 'check win condition' funcionality works with lines bigger than 3 units
        • Have default player names for better identification
        • Think about how the turns are applied:
            • Make computer pick a random spot from all empty spots
            • Test hasVicotry functionality coupled with boardWidget


    Javascipt — Pure-Function Branch:

        • Maybe decopuple all functions from player object, leaving it only with data (name, score, symbol, color)
        • make hasVictory its own function, with all extra functions internal to it


    CSS:

        • Find decent symbols to use in the game, that are svg
        • Figure out how to change the color of embeded svg
        • Pick good fonts
        • Set the three color schemes:
            • Dark and light brown, Dark and Light green, Silver;
            • Navy blue, Yellow and silver;
            • Graphite, yellow, pink and silver;
            • Graphite, yellow, pink, blue
            • Shades of gray — Lighter graphite and darker silver (instead of white)
        • Makke the tic-tac-toe letters animate
        • Use a 5x5 grid to add some X's and O's
        • Which symbols should I add to the game?


    HTML-DOM:

        • Create the pickGameMode modal (vs player, vs ai)
        • Create the pickGridSize modal (3x3, 5x5, 7x7)
        • Create Title screen with new game button
        • Create Grid screen with the current match
        • The flow of the app will be seen by openinig-closing modals, as well as changing screens (detach one, attach another).

Features that could be cool:

    • Each person can customize their symbol and color
    • The game has different color schemes
    • Maybe putting a three people mode?
    • Add cards\special resources to spice the gameplay up?
